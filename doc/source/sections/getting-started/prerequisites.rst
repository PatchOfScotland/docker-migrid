Prerequisites
=============

Docker
------

Because Docker MiGrid is based on deploying the various services with Docker.
The natural implicatation is that Docker has to be installed before it can be deployed.

Depending on which operating system you are thinking of deploying Docker Migrid to,
you have to follow the Docker installation guide that is applicable to your system.
Details on this can be found at::

    https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/


Docker-Compose
--------------

In addition to Docker, the deployment of Docker MiGrid is configured as such, that it expects you to deploy it 
with the `docker-compose` tool. Similarly to Docker, the installation guide for your particular system can be found at::

    https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/


With these items installed, you are now ready to build Docker MiGrid.


Additional Notes
----------------

Note to self, validate that the CentOS 7 install works as expected
