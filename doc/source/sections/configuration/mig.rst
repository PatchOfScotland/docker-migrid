Minimum intrusion Grid
======================

MiG or The Minimum intrusion Grid can be configured in a number of ways.

The implementation is based on having a central MiGserver.conf configuration that is typically located
in the `~/mig/server` directory. The other important aspect of configuring the MiG, is the asociated Apache service which is 
configured via a number of Apache configuration files.
